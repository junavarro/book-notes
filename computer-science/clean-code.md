## Chapter 2: Meaningful names (by Tim Ottinger)

- Using itention revealing names, functions.
    - Change them if you find better names.
    - A proper name should answer the following questions:
        - why it exists ?
        - what it does ?
        - how it is used ?
    - If the name requires (extensive) comments, then it is not the correct name.
  - Simplicity vs implicity.
    - Implicity: The degree to which the context is not explicit in the code.
    - Information - Disinformation - Non-information (page 21)
    - Avoid `Noise-words`
  - Make names pronounceable.
    - Programming is a social activity.
  - Use Searchable names
  - Avoid mental mapping: `problem_domain_termns`, `solution_domain_termns`
  - Classes
      - A class name never contain a verb. Avoid words: `Manager, Processor, Data, Info`
  - Methods in Classes:
      - Use Java Bean convention
  - Use one word per concep rule. Use one of this: Driver, Controller, Manager.
